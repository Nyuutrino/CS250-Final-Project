# Phantom Dash
A project made by CS Students for their CS-250 final project
Features a procedurally generated path for the player to traverse
## Why Make it?
* We thought it would be a cool test of our skills to make a procedurally generated game
* Thought it would be a relatively simple & cool concept (spoiler: it was _not_ simple)
## How to play?
* Download the jar from the releases section
* Run jar (make sure you have JRE installed on your computer)
* Enjoy :)
